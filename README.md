# NEET Analysis in Brazil (PNAD Cont√≠nua)

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes **NEET youth in Brazil** (Not in Employment, Education, or Training),  
with a particular focus on the **Northeast region**. The study is based on the PNAD Cont√≠nua microdata,  
accessed via the [Base dos Dados](https://basedosdados.org/) platform.

The main objectives are:
- Build a **raw dataset** from PNAD microdata (2023‚Äì2025).
- Organize and clean variables (sex, age, education, labor status, etc.).
- Define and identify the **NEET population** (15‚Äì24 years old).
- Explore key characteristics of NEET youth:
  - Gender distribution
  - Age groups
  - Educational attainment
  - Regional focus (Northeast)
  - Additional sociodemographic variables

## üóÇ Data Source
- **PNAD Cont√≠nua (IBGE)**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Data Extraction**  
   - SQL query selects relevant PNAD variables.  
   - Saved as `dados_brutos.csv`.  

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Convert raw codes into interpretable labels.  
   - Example: `sex_code` ‚Üí `female` (1 = Female, 0 = Male).  
   - Drop unused variables (e.g., `children_under14_code`).  

3. **Filtering Scope**  
   - Focus on **Q1 2025**.  
   - Age filter: **15‚Äì24 years old**.  

4. **NEET Definition**  
   - Not in school (`school_code = 2`).  
   - Not employed (`occupation_code != 1` OR `labor_force_code = 2`).
